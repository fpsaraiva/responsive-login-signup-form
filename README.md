# responsive-login-signup-form

## ðŸ’» Project

As part of the bootcamp program that I'm taking part at the moment ([Growdev Starter](https://www.growdev.com.br/starter)), I've created this responsive interface using Bootstrap.

The idea was to practice the frontend development workflow of a single interface, one that could be used as part of a larger project.

- Responsiveness, specially fields and buttons width.
- Include actions into "Forgot Password?" link.

Development workflow was based in Adrian Twarog's ["Login Form HTML CSS | Bootstrap 5" tutorial"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ENJ_xd625s&ab_channel=AdrianTwarog). The inspiration for a combinbed Login and Signup form came from [this](https://codepen.io/j9159573241/pen/rNNvZRy) Codepen project.
